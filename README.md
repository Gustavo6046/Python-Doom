# Python-Doom
A Python codebase for Doom-based games

Python Doom is... erm, a codebase for Doom-based games. Want me to clarify? Well, it's either an id Tech 1 source port or an entire non-id-Tech-1 game. We still didn't decided for it. This includes Python code for **physics, map format, actors, OpenGL** and mainly **BOTS**.
